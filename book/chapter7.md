# Chapter 7 - Tables and for-loops

## Tables
Tables are basically lists in which we can store values.

You create a table with curly brackets ({ }):

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {}

end
```

We just created a table called fruits. Now we can store values inside the table. There are multiple ways to do this.

One way is to put the values inside the curly brackets.

```lua
function love.load()
	-- Each value is separated by a comma, just like with parameters and arguments
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
end
```

We can also use the function `table.insert`. The first argument is the table, the second argument is the value we want to store inside that table.

```lua
function love.load()
	--Each value is separated by a comma, just like with parameters and arguments
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")
end
```

So now after love.load our table will contain `"apple"`, `"banana"` and `"pear"`. To prove that, let's put the values on screen. For that we're going to use `love.graphics.print(text, x, y)`.

```lua
function love.draw()
	--Arguments: (text, x-position, y-position)
	love.graphics.print("Test", 100, 100)
end
```

When you run the game, you should see the text "test" written. We can access the values of our table by writing the tables name, followed by brackets ([ ]) (So not curly but square brackets!). Inside these brackets, we write the position of the value we want.

Like I said, tables are a list of values. We first added `"apple"` and `"banana"`, so those are on the first and second position in the list. Next we added `"pear"`, so that's on the third position in the list. On position 4 there is no value (yet), since we only added 3 values.

So if we want to print `"apple"`, we have to get the first value of the list.

```lua
function love.draw()
	love.graphics.print(fruits[1], 100, 100)
end
```

And so now it should draw `"apple"`. If you replace the `[1]` with `[2]`, you should get `"banana"`, and with `[3]` you get `"pear"`.

Now we want to draw all 3 fruits. We could use love.graphics.print 3 times, each with a different table entry...

```lua
function love.draw()
	love.graphics.print(fruits[1], 100, 100)
	love.graphics.print(fruits[2], 100, 200)
	love.graphics.print(fruits[3], 100, 300)
end
```

...but imagine if we had 100 values in our table. Luckily, there's a solution for this: for-loops!

## for-loops

A for-loop is a way to repeat a piece of code a certain amount of times.

You create a for-loop like this:

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")

	for i=1,10 do
		print("hello", i)
	end
end
```

If you run the game you should see it prints hello 1, hello 2, hello 3, all the way to 10.

To create a for-loop, first you write `for`. Next you write a variable and give it a numeric value. This is where the for-loop starts. The variable can be named anything, but it's common to use `i`. This variable can only be used inside the for-loop (just like with functions and parameters). Next you write the number to which it should count. So for example `for i=6,18 do` will start at 6 and keep looping till it's at 18.

There is also a third, optional number. This is by how much the variable increases. `for i=6,18,4 do` would go: 6, 10, 14, 18. With this you can also make for-loops go backwards with -1.

Our table starts at 1 and has 3 values, so we will write:

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")

	for i=1,3 do
		print(fruits[i])
	end
end
```

When you run the game you'll see that it prints all 3 fruits. In the first loop it prints `fruits[1]`, then in the second loop `fruits[2]`and finally in the third loop `fruits[3]`.

## Editing tables

But what if we add or remove a value from a table? We would have to change the 3 into another number. For that we use `#fruits`. With the #-sign, we can get the length of a table. The length of a table refers to the number of things in that table. That length would be `3` in our case, since we have 3 entries: `apple`, `banana`, and `pear` in our `fruits` table.

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}

	print(#fruits)
	--Output: 2

	table.insert(fruits, "pear")

	print(#fruits)
	--Output: 3

	for i=1,#fruits do
		print(fruits[i])
	end
end
```

Let's use this knowledge to draw all 3 fruits.

```lua
function love.draw()
	for i=1,#fruits do
		love.graphics.print(fruits[i], 100, 100)
	end
end
```

If you run the game you should see it draws all 3 fruits, except they're all drawn on the same position. We can fix this by printing each number on a different height.

```lua
function love.draw()
	for i=1,#fruits do
		love.graphics.print(fruits[i], 100, 100 + 50 * i)
	end
end
```

So now `"apple"` will be drawn on the y-position 100 + 50 * 1, which is 150. Then `"banana"` gets drawn on 200, and `"pear"` on 250.

If we were to add another fruit, we won't have to change anything. It will automatically be drawn. Let's add `"pineapple"`.

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")
	table.insert(fruits, "pineapple")
end
```

We can also remove values from our table. For that we use `table.remove`. The first argument is the table we want to remove something from, the second argument is the position we want to remove. So if we want to remove banana, we do the following:

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")
	table.insert(fruits, "pineapple")
	table.remove(fruits, 2)
end
```

When you run the game you'll see that banana is no longer drawn, and that pear and pineapple have moved up.

![](/images/book/7/shift.png)

When you remove a value from a table with `table.remove`, all the following items in the table will move up. So what was on position 3 is now on position 2 in the table. And what was on position 4 is now on position 3.

You can also add or change the values inside the table directly. For example, we can change `"apple"` into `"tomato"`:

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")
	table.insert(fruits, "pineapple")
	table.remove(fruits, 2)
	--The value of position 1 in the table becomes "tomato"
	fruits[1] = "tomato"
end
```

## ipairs

Back to the for-loops. There is actually another way, and an easier way to loop through the table. We can use an `ipairs` loop.

```lua
function love.load()
	fruits = {"apple", "banana"}
	table.insert(fruits, "pear")
	table.insert(fruits, "pineapple")
	table.remove(fruits, 2)
	fruits[1] = "tomato"

	for i,v in ipairs(fruits) do
		print(i, v)
	end
	--Output:
	--1, "tomato"
	--2, "pear"
	--3, "pineapple"
end
```

This for-loop loops, or what we also call *iterates*, through all the values in the table. The variables `i` tells us the position of the table, `v` is the value of that position in the table. It's basically a shorthand for `fruits[i]`. For example, in the first iteration the values for the variables  `i` would be `1` and `v` would be `"tomato"`. In the second iteration, `i` and `v` would be `2` and `"pear"` respectively.

But how does it work? Why does the function `ipairs` allow for this? That is for another time. For now all you need to know is that `ipairs` is basically a shorthand for the following:

```lua
for i=1, #fruits do
	v = fruits[i]
end
```

Let's use `ipairs` for drawing our tables.

```lua
function love.draw()
	-- i and v are variables, so we can name them whatever we want
	for i,frt in ipairs(fruits) do
		love.graphics.print(frt, 100, 100 + 50 * i)
	end
end
```

## Summary
Tables are lists in which we can store values. We store these values when creating the table, with `table.insert`, or with `table_name[1] = "some_value"`. We can get the length of the table with `#table_name`. With for-loops we can repeat a piece of code a number of times. We can also use for-loops to iterate through tables.
