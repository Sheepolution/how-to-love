## Falling

Now that we can resolve collision we can make a platformer. A game where you fall down and can jump up. First let's create a map for us to walk around in. We can remove the single wall we added.

```lua
function love.load()
    Object = require "classic"
    require "entity"
    require "player"
    require "wall"
    require "box"

    player = Player(100, 100)
    box = Box(400, 150)

    objects = {}
    table.insert(objects, player)
    table.insert(objects, box)

    map = {
		{1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1},
		{1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}
    }

    for i,v in ipairs(map) do
		for j,w in ipairs(v) do
			if w == 1 then
			    table.insert(objects, Wall((j-1)*50, (i-1)*50))
			end
		end
    end
end
```

Depending on how good your computer is, you might notice that the game has become very slow. This is because all the walls we added are checking collision with each other. This is very inefficient, because there is no need to check this. The walls never move so they will never overlap with each other. Instead, we should create a separate table for all the walls. The `objects` table checks collision with itself and the `walls` table, but the `walls` table does not check for collision with itself.

```lua
function love.load()
    Object = require "classic"
    require "entity"
    require "player"
    require "wall"
    require "box"

    player = Player(100, 100)
    box = Box(400, 150)

    objects = {}
    table.insert(objects, player)
    table.insert(objects, box)

    --Create the walls table
	---- ADD THIS
    walls = {}
	-------------

    map = {
		{1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1},
		{1,0,0,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1},
		{1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1}
    }

    for i,v in ipairs(map) do
		for j,w in ipairs(v) do
			if w == 1 then
				-- Add all the walls to the walls table instead.
				---- CHANGE THIS
			    table.insert(walls, Wall((j-1)*50, (i-1)*50))
				-------------
			end
		end
    end
end

function love.update(dt)
    for i,v in ipairs(objects) do
        v:update(dt)
    end

    -- Update the walls
	---- ADD THIS
    for i,v in ipairs(walls) do
        v:update(dt)
    end
	-------------

    local loop = true
    local limit = 0

    while loop do
        loop = false

        limit = limit + 1
        if limit > 100 then
			break
        end

        for i=1,#objects-1 do
            for j=i+1,#objects do
                local collision = objects[i]:resolveCollision(objects[j])
                if collision then
                    loop = true
                end
            end
        end
    	
    	-- For each object check collision with every wall.
		---- ADD THIS
        for i,wall in ipairs(walls) do
			for j,object in ipairs(objects) do
				local collision = object:resolveCollision(wall)
				if collision then
					loop = true
				end
			end
        end
		-------------
    end
end

function love.draw()
    for i,v in ipairs(objects) do
        v:draw()
    end

	-- Draw the walls
	---- ADD THIS
    for i,v in ipairs(walls) do
        v:draw()
    end
	-------------
end
```

Okay so now we can start adding platformer physics. Let's start with falling. In `player.lua` we already make the player move down when we press the down-key. By removing that if-statement the player will automatically fall down.

```lua
--! file: player.lua
function Player:update(dt)
    Player.super.update(self, dt)

    if love.keyboard.isDown("left") then
        self.x = self.x - 200 * dt
    elseif love.keyboard.isDown("right") then
        self.x = self.x + 200 * dt
    end

    if love.keyboard.isDown("up") then
        self.y = self.y - 200 * dt
    end

    -- Remove the if-statement
    self.y = self.y + 200 * dt
end
```

![](/images/book/24/falling.gif)

It works, the object falls down, but this isn't how gravity works. An object should slowly fall, and as it falls it should gain speed. Let's create something that looks more like real gravity in the `Entity` class. We need a `gravity` and `weight` property. We use the `gravity` property to increase the y-position of the entity, and we use the `weight` property to increase the gravity. So we increase how fast we're falling.


```lua
--! file: entity.lua
function Entity:new(x, y, image_path)
    self.x = x
    self.y = y
    self.image = love.graphics.newImage(image_path)
    self.width = self.image:getWidth()
    self.height = self.image:getHeight()

    self.last = {}
    self.last.x = self.x
    self.last.y = self.y

    self.strength = 0
    self.tempStrength = 0

    -- Add the gravity and weight properties
    self.gravity = 0
    self.weight = 400
end

function Entity:update(dt)
    self.last.x = self.x
    self.last.y = self.y

    self.tempStrength = self.strength

    -- Increase the gravity using the weight
    self.gravity = self.gravity + self.weight * dt

    -- Increase the y-position
    self.y = self.y + self.gravity * dt
end
```

Since the walls don't need to fall, we can give it a `weight` of 0.

```lua
--! file: wall.lua
Wall = Entity:extend()

function Wall:new(x, y)
    Wall.super.new(self, x, y, "wall.png", 1)
    self.strength = 100
    self.weight = 0
end
```

And we can remove the part of the player that makes it automatically fall, as well as moving up by pressing the up-key.

```lua
--! file: player.lua
function Player:update(dt)
    -- It's important that we do this before changing the position
    Player.super.update(self, dt)

    if love.keyboard.isDown("left") then
        self.x = self.x - 200 * dt
    elseif love.keyboard.isDown("right") then
        self.x = self.x + 200 * dt
    end

    -- Remove the vertical movement
end
```

And now our player and box are falling as their fall speed increases.

![](/images/book/24/gravity.gif)

But when you run the game long enough you might notice that the player and box fall right through the floor. This is because the gravity keeps increasing even though they are standing on the floor. We need to reset the gravity as they stand on the floor. We can do this in `Entity:resolveCollision(e)`.

```lua
--! file: entity.lua
function Entity:resolveCollision(e)
    if self.tempStrength > e.tempStrength then
        return e:resolveCollision(self)
    end

    if self:checkCollision(e) then
        self.tempStrength = e.tempStrength
        if self:wasVerticallyAligned(e) then
            if self.x + self.width/2 < e.x + e.width/2 then
                local pushback = self.x + self.width - e.x
                self.x = self.x - pushback
            else
                local pushback = e.x + e.width - self.x
                self.x = self.x + pushback
            end
        elseif self:wasHorizontallyAligned(e) then
            if self.y + self.height/2 < e.y + e.height/2 then
                local pushback = self.y + self.height - e.y
                self.y = self.y - pushback
                -- We're touching a wall from the bottom
                -- This means we're standing on the ground.
                -- Reset the gravity
				---- ADD THIS
                self.gravity = 0
				-------------
            else
                local pushback = e.y + e.height - self.y
                self.y = self.y + pushback
            end
        end
        return true
    end
    return false
end
```

And now they don't fall through the wall anymore.

## Jumping

Now it's time to make the player able to jump. We make it jump when the up-key is pressed. So first let's add the `love.keypressed(key)` callback to `main.lua`, and have it call the function `jump()` of the player, which we will make in a moment.


```lua
--! file: main.lua
function love.keypressed(key)
	-- Let the player jump when the up-key is pressed
	if key == "up" then
		player:jump()
	end
end
```

So what needs to happen to make the player jump? It's actually very easy. We simply give the gravity a negative value. The lower the value (or in other words the more negative the value) the higher the player jumps.

```
--! file: player.lua
function Player:jump()
	self.gravity = -300
end
```

As the player's gravity changes, it jumps in the air and slowly falls as the gravity keeps increasing.

![](/images/book/24/jumping.gif)

But when you try you will notice that we can jump multiple times. We don't want that. You only should be able to jump when you stand on the ground. We can do this by adding a `canJump` property to the player. When you land on the ground the property becomes `true`, and when you jump, which you can only do when `canJump` is `true`, it becomes `false`.

```lua
function Player:new(x, y)
    Player.super.new(self, x, y, "player.png")
    self.strength = 10

    self.canJump = false
end

function Player:update(dt)
    Player.super.update(self, dt)

    if love.keyboard.isDown("left") then
        self.x = self.x - 200 * dt
    elseif love.keyboard.isDown("right") then
        self.x = self.x + 200 * dt
    end

    -- Remove the if-statement
    -- self.y = self.y + 200 * dt
end


function Player:jump()
    if self.canJump then
        self.gravity = -300
        self.canJump = false
    end
end
```

But right now if we want to do an action as we land, in this case setting `canJump` to `true`, we have to do it in the `Entity` class. Something we could technically do, but this jumping code is for the player specifically. Let's add a function that is called upon resolving collision, so that we can override those functions in the `Player` class.

```lua
--! file: entity.lua
function Entity:resolveCollision(e)
    if self.tempStrength > e.tempStrength then
        return e:resolveCollision(self)
    end

    if self:checkCollision(e) then
        self.tempStrength = e.tempStrength
        if self:wasVerticallyAligned(e) then
            if self.x + self.width/2 < e.x + e.width/2 then
            	-- Replace these with the functions
                self:collide(e, "right")
            else
                self:collide(e, "left")
            end
        elseif self:wasHorizontallyAligned(e) then
            if self.y + self.height/2 < e.y + e.height/2 then
                self:collide(e, "bottom")
            else
                self:collide(e, "top")
            end
        end
        return true
    end
    return false
end

-- When the entity collides with something with his right side
function Entity:collide(e, direction)
	if direction == "right" then
	    local pushback = self.x + self.width - e.x
	    self.x = self.x - pushback
	elseif direction == "left" then
	    local pushback = e.x + e.width - self.x
	    self.x = self.x + pushback
	elseif direction == "bottom" then
	    local pushback = self.y + self.height - e.y
	    self.y = self.y - pushback
	    self.gravity = 0
	elseif direction == "top" then
	    local pushback = e.y + e.height - self.y
	    self.y = self.y + pushback
	end
end
```

And now we can override the function `collide(e)` and set `canJump` to `false` when `direction` is `bottom`.

```lua
--! file: player.lua
function Player:collide(e, direction)
    Player.super.collide(self, e, direction)
    if direction == "bottom" then
	    self.canJump = true
    end
end
```

And now we can only jump once. But we still can jump mid-air when you walk off of a platform and jump.

![](/images/book/24/midair.gif)

We can fix this by checking if the previous y-position is not equal to the current y-position. When you're standing on the ground, you should not be moving vertically. So if you are it means you're not standing on the ground.


```lua
function Player:update(dt)
    Player.super.update(self, dt)

    if love.keyboard.isDown("left") then
        self.x = self.x - 200 * dt
    elseif love.keyboard.isDown("right") then
        self.x = self.x + 200 * dt
    end

    if self.last.y ~= self.y then
        self.canJump = false
    end
end
```

Nice! It's very common in platformers that you need to hit something from a certain direction. Think of Mario for example. You get only something out of the question mark when hit it from the bottom, and you can only kill an enemy by jumping on top of it. A more advanced example maybe is platforms you can jump through. When you hit it from the bottom you jump through it, but hitting it from the top makes you stand on top of it. 

![](/images/book/24/platform.png)

Let's try to create such platform.

___

## Jump-through platform

We're going to use our box for this. We want to make it so that the player does not push the box but instead walks right through it. When it jumps on the box it stands on top of it. To make this happen we need to make some changes again. The function `collide(e, direction)` is for what should happen when collision is resolved. But we don't want the collision to be resolved. We want to be able to walk through the box.

How about we first check if both parties of the collision want the collision to be resolved. We create a function called `checkResolved`. If both `self` and `e` return `true`, then we continue with resolving the collision.

```lua
--! file: entity.lua
function Entity:resolveCollision(e)
    if self.tempStrength > e.tempStrength then
        return e:resolveCollision(self)
    end

    if self:checkCollision(e) then
        self.tempStrength = e.tempStrength
        if self:wasVerticallyAligned(e) then
            if self.x + self.width/2 < e.x + e.width/2 then
            	-- Call checkResolve for both parties.
                local a = self:checkResolve(e, "right")
                local b = e:checkResolve(self, "left")
            	-- If both a and b are true then resolve the collision.
                if a and b then
                    self:collide(e, "right")
                end
            else
                local a = self:checkResolve(e, "left")
                local b = e:checkResolve(self, "right")
                if a and b then
                    self:collide(e, "left")
                end
            end
        elseif self:wasHorizontallyAligned(e) then
            if self.y + self.height/2 < e.y + e.height/2 then
                local a = self:checkResolve(e, "bottom")
                local b = e:checkResolve(self, "top")
                if a and b then
                    self:collide(e, "bottom")
                end
            else
                local a = self:checkResolve(e, "top")
                local b = e:checkResolve(self, "bottom")
                if a and b then
                    self:collide(e, "top")
                end
            end
        end
        return true
    end
    return false
end


function Entity:checkResolve(e, direction)
    return true
end
```

Now in `player.lua` we can override the function `checkResolve(e, direction)`. With classic, the class library we're using, every class has the function `is:(class)` which can be used to check if an instance of a class is of a certain type of class. So we can use `e:is(Box)` to check if `e` is of the type `Box`. This also works with base classes. So if `e` were to be a box, then `e:is(Entity)` would return `true`, since `Box` is an extension of the base class `Entity`.

We first check if we're colliding with a `Box`, and if so, we check if the `direction` is `"bottom"`. If so, return `true` (meaning we want collision to be resolved), else return `false`. 

```lua
--! file: player.lua 
function Player:checkResolve(e, direction)
    if e:is(Box) then
        if direction == "bottom" then
        	return true
        else
        	return false
      	end
    end
    return true
end
```

## Summary

By increasing the value that we use to increase our y-position we can simulate gravity. We can jump by setting the gravity to a negative value. By adding functions and overriding those functions we can apply actions upon collision, or prevent collision from happening.

## The end?

And with that we're at the end of this chapter, and at the end of this book (for now!). I hope you enjoyed reading all the chapters and of course learned a lot by reading them.  I still have plans for new chapters, but that is for another time. Until then I wish you good luck on your journey to become an even greater game programmer than you already are. I recommend [learn2love](https://rvagamejams.com/learn2love/) if you want to learn more. It goes more in-depth on the topics I covered, and also has chapters on networking.

Remmember to practice a lot. Like I said in the introduction, you can read about painting all you want, but to learn it you have to do it. Same goes for programming. Cheers!
