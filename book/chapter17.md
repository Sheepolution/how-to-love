# Chapter 17 - Animation

## Frames

Let's make an animated image.

First, you'll need some images:

![](/images/book/17/jump1.png), ![](/images/book/17/jump2.png), ![](/images/book/17/jump3.png), ![](/images/book/17/jump4.png) and ![](/images/book/17/jump5.png)

You can also download them as a zip [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1bMVMUv-B0XF9nBJfw_7ek781cmUjrdgn/view?usp=sharing)

Load the images and put them in a table.

```lua
function love.load()
	frames = {}

	table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newImage("jump1.png"))
	table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newImage("jump2.png"))
	table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newImage("jump3.png"))
	table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newImage("jump4.png"))
	table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newImage("jump5.png"))
end
```

Hold on, we can do this much more efficiently.

```lua
function love.load()
	frames = {}
	
	for i=1,5 do
		table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newImage("jump" .. i .. ".png"))
	end
end
```

That's better! Now we need to create an animation. How will we do that?

*A for-loop?*

Nope. A for-loop would let us draw all the frames at the same time, but we want to draw a different frame every second. We need a variable that increases by 1 every second. Well that's easy!

```lua
function love.load()
	frames = {}
	
	for i=1,5 do
		table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newImage("jump" .. i .. ".png"))
	end

	--I use a long name to avoid confusion with the variable named frames
	currentFrame = 1
end


function love.update(dt)
	currentFrame = currentFrame + dt
end
```

Now we have the variable `currentFrame` which increases by 1 every second, let's use this variable to draw the frames.

```lua
function love.draw()
	love.graphics.draw(frames[currentFrame])
end
```

If you run the game you'll get an error: *bad argument #1 to 'draw' (Drawable expected, got nil)*

This is because our variable `currentFrame` has decimals. After the first update `currentFrame` is something like 1.016, and while our table has something on position 1 and 2, there is nothing on position 1.016.

To solve this we round the number down with `math.floor`. So 1.016 will become 1.

```lua
function love.draw()
	love.graphics.draw(frames[math.floor(currentFrame)])
end
```

Run the game and you'll see that our animation works, but you'll eventually get an error. This is because currentFrame became higher than (or equal to) 6. And we only have 5 frames. To solve this, we reset `currentFrame` if it gets higher than (or equal to) 6. And while we're at it, let's speed up our animation.

```lua
function love.update(dt)
	currentFrame = currentFrame + 10 * dt
	if currentFrame >= 6 then
		currentFrame = 1
	end
end
```

Look at him go!

## Quads

So this works, but it's not very efficient. With large animations we're going to need a lot of images. What if we put all the frames into 1 image, and then draw part of the image. We can do this with quads.

First, download this image:

![](/images/book/17/jump.png)

We'll remake the function `love.load` (you can keep `love.update` and `love.draw` the way it is).

```lua
function love.load()
	image = love.graphics.newImage("jump.png")
end
```

Imagine quads like a rectangle that we cut out of our image. We tell the game "We want this part of the image". We're going to make a quad of the first frame. You can make a quad with `love.graphics.newQuad` [(wiki)](https://love2d.org/wiki/love.graphics.newQuad).

The first arguments are the x and y position of our quad. Well since we want the first frame we take the upper-left corner of our image, so 0,0.

```lua
function love.load()
	image = love.graphics.newImage("jump.png")
	frames = {}
	table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newQuad(0, 0))
end
```

Again, quads are like cutting a piece of paper. Where we will eventually draw our image is not relevant to the quad.

![](/images/book/17/quad_position.png)

Next 2 arguments are the width and height of our quad. The width of a frame in our image is 117 and the height is 233. The last 2 arguments are the width and height of the full image. We can get these with `image:getWidth()` and `image:getHeight()`.

```lua
function love.load()
	image = love.graphics.newImage("jump.png")
	frames = {}
	local frame_width = 117
	local frame_height = 233
	table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newQuad(0, 0, frame_width, frame_height, image:getWidth(), image:getHeight()))

    currentFrame = 1
end
```

Now let's test our quad by drawing it. You draw a quad by passing it as second argument in `love.graphics.draw`.

```lua
function love.draw()
	love.graphics.draw(image, frames[1], 100, 100)
end
```

As you can see it's drawing our first frame. Great, now let's make the second quad.

To draw the second frame all we need to do is move the rectangle to the right. Since each frame has a width of 117, all we need to do is move our x to the right with 117.

```lua
function love.load()
	image = love.graphics.newImage("jump.png")
	frames = {}
	local frame_width = 117
	local frame_height = 233
	table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newQuad(0, 0, frame_width, frame_height, image:getWidth(), image:getHeight()))
	table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newQuad(frame_width, 0, frame_width, frame_height, image:getWidth(), image:getHeight()))
end
```

And we can do the same for the 3rd quad.

![](/images/book/17/jump_help.png)

Wait, are we repeating the same action? Don't we have something for that? For-loops! Also, we can prevent calling :getWidth and :getHeight multiple times by storing the values in a variable.

```lua
function love.load()
	image = love.graphics.newImage("jump.png")
	local width = image:getWidth()
	local height = image:getHeight() 

	frames = {}

	local frame_width = 117
	local frame_height = 233

	for i=0,4 do
		table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newQuad(i * frame_width, 0, frame_width, frame_height, width, height))
	end

	currentFrame = 1
end
```

Notice how we start our for-loop on 0 and end it on 4, instead of 1 to 5. This is because our first quad is on position 0, and 0 * 177 equals 0.

Now all that is left to do is use currentFrame for the quad we want to draw.

```lua
function love.draw()
	love.graphics.draw(image, frames[math.floor(currentFrame)], 100, 100)
end
```

## Multiple rows

So we can now turn a row of frames into an animation, but what if we have multiple rows?

![](/images/book/17/jump_2.png)

Easy, we just have to repeat the same thing with a different y value.

```lua
function love.load()
	image = love.graphics.newImage("jump_2.png")
	local width = image:getWidth()
	local height = image:getHeight() 

	frames = {}

	local frame_width = 117
	local frame_height = 233

	for i=0,2 do
		table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newQuad(i * frame_width, 0, frame_width, frame_height, width, height))
	end

	for i=0,1 do
		table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newQuad(i * frame_width, frame_height, frame_width, frame_height, width, height))
	end

	currentFrame = 1
end
```

But wait, there it is again: Repetition! And what do we do when we see repetition? We use a for-loop.

*So what, like, a for-loop inside a for-loop?*

Exactly! We're going to have to make a few changes though.

```lua
function love.load()
	image = love.graphics.newImage("jump_2.png")
	local width = image:getWidth()
	local height = image:getHeight() 

	frames = {}

	local frame_width = 117
	local frame_height = 233

	for i=0,1 do
		--I changed i to j in the inner for-loop
		for j=0,2 do
			--Meaning you also need to change it here
			table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newQuad(j * frame_width, i * frame_height, frame_width, frame_height, width, height))
		end
	end

	currentFrame = 1
end
```

So in the first iteration of the outer for-loop, i equals 0, and j equals 0, then 1 and finally 2.
In the second iteration, i equals 1, and j again equals 0, then 1 and finally 2.

You might notice that we have an extra, empty quad. This isn't really a big deal since we only draw the first 5 quads, but we can do something like this to prevent it

```lua
maxFrames = 5
for i=0,1 do
	for j=0,2 do
		table.insert(frames, love.graphics.newQuad(j * frame_width, i * frame_height, frame_width, frame_height, width, height))
		if #frames == maxFrames then
			break
		end 
	end
	print("I don't break!")
end
```

With `break` we can end a for-loop. This will prevent it from adding that last quad.

Note how *"I don't break"* gets printed. This is because `break` only breaks the loop you use it in, the outer loop still continues. It could be fixed by adding the same if-statement in our outer-loop, but in our case it doesn't matter since the loop at that point is already on its last iteration.

## Bleeding

When rotating and/or scaling an image while using quads, an effect can appear called *bleeding*. What happens is that part of the image outside of the quad gets drawn.

So if this was our spritesheet:

![](/images/book/17/rectangles1.png)

Our first frame could end up like this:

![](/images/book/17/bleeding.png)

It's kind of technical why this happens, but the fact is that it does happen. Luckily, we can solve this issue by adding a 1 pixel border around our frame. 
Either of the same color as the actually border, or with transparency.

![](/images/book/17/bleeding_fix.png)

And then we don't include that border inside the quad.

I added a border to our jumping character. Instead of transparent I made it purple so that we can see if we're not accidentally drawing part of the border.

![](/images/book/17/jump_3.png)

Let's do this step by step.

First, we do not want the first pixel to be drawn, so our quad starts at 1 (instead of 0).

```lua
newQuad(1, 1, frame_width, frame_height, width, height)
```

Okay so this works for the first frame, but what part of the next frame do we want to draw? Simply add the frame width/height?


```lua
newQuad(1 + j * frame_width, 1 + i * frame_height, frame_width, frame_height, width, height)
```

Almost. We're missing something.

![](/images/book/17/almost.png)

The blue line is our quad. As you can see, the quad is 2 pixels to the left of where it's supposed to be. So let's add 2 to how much we move each iteration.

```lua
newQuad(1 + j * (frame_width + 2), 1 + i * (frame_height + 2), frame_width, frame_height, width, height)
```

And now our quads are in the correct position. Here's an image visualizing how we position the quad. So we add 1, then add `frame_width` + 2, multiplied by `i`. This way we position the quad correctly for each frame.

## Summary

With quads we can draw part of an image. we can use this to turn a spritesheet into an animation. In case of multiple rows we can use a for-loop inside a for-loop to cover the whole sheet. We can use `break` to end a loop. We add a 1 pixel border to our sprites to prevent *bleeding*.
