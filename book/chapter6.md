# Chapter 6 - If-statements
___
*We use the code from the previous chapter*
___
With if-statements, we can allow pieces of code to only be executed when a condition is met.

You create an if-statement like this:
```lua
if condition then
	-- code
end
```

A condition, or statement, is something that's either true or false.

For example: `5 > 9`

The `>` means, higher than. So the statement is that 5 is higher than 9, which is false.

Put an if-statement around the code of x increasing.

```lua
function love.update(dt)
	if 5 > 9 then
		x = x + 100 * dt
	end
end
```

When you run the game you'll notice that our rectangle isn't moving. This is because the statement is false. If we were to change the statement to `5 < 9` (5 is lower than 9), then the statement is true, and the code inside the if-statement will execute.

With this, we can for example make `x` go up to 600, and then make it stop moving, with `x < 600`.

```lua
function love.update(dt)
	if x < 600 then
		x = x + 100 * dt
	end
end
```

If we want to check if a value is equal to another value, we need to use 2 equal-signs (==).

For example: `4 == 7`

1 equal-sign is for assigning, 2 equal-signs is for comparing.

```lua
x = 10 --Assign 10 to x
x == 10 --Compare 10 to x
```

We can also use `>=` and `<=` to check if values are higher or equal to each other or if the values are lower and equal to each other.

```lua
10 <= 10 --true, 10 equals to 10
15 >= 4 --true, 15 is higher than 4
```

So the code above is a shorthand for
```lua
10 == 10 or 10 < 10
15 == 4 or 15 > 4
```

## Boolean

A variable can also be `true` or `false`. This type of variable is what we call a boolean.

Let's make a new variable called `move`, with the value `true`, and check if `move` is `true` in our if-statement.

```lua
function love.load()
	x = 100
	move = true
end

function love.update(dt)
	-- Remember, 2 equal signs!
	if move == true then
		x = x + 100 * dt
	end
end
```

`move` is `true`, so our rectangle moves. But `move == true` is actually redundant. We're checking if it's true that the value of `move` is `true`. Simply using `move` as a statement is good enough.

```lua
if move then
	x = x + 100 * dt
end
```

If we want to check if `move` is `false`, we can put a `not` in front of it.

```lua
if not move then
	x = x + 100 * dt
end
```

If we want to check if a number is NOT equal to another number, we use a tilde (~).

```lua
if 4 ~= 5 then
	x = x + 100 * dt
end
```

We can also assign `true` or `false` to a variable with a statement.

For example: `move = 6 > 3`.

If we check if move is true, and then change move to false inside the if-statement, it's not as if we jump out of the if-statement. All the code below will still be executed.

```lua
if move then
	move = false
	print("This will still be executed!")
	x = x + 100 * dt
end
```

## Arrow keys
Let's make the rectangle move based on if we hold down the right arrowkey. For this we use the function `love.keyboard.isDown` [(wiki)](https://www.love2d.org/wiki/love.keyboard.isDown).

Notice how the D of Down is uppercase. This is type of casing is what we call camelCasing. We start the first word in lowercase, and then every following word's first character we type in uppercase. This type of casing is also what we will be using for our variables throughout this tutorial.

We pass the string "right" as first argument to check if the right arrowkey is down.
```lua
if love.keyboard.isDown("right") then
	x = x + 100 * dt
end
```

So now only when we hold down the right arrowkey does our rectangle move.

We can also use `else` to tell our game what to do when the condition is `false`. Let's make our rectangle move to the left, when we don't press right.

```lua
if love.keyboard.isDown("right") then
	x = x + 100 * dt
else
	x = x - 100 * dt --We decrease the value of x
end
```

We can also check if another statement is true, after the first is false, with `elseif`. Let's make it so that after checking if the right arrowkey is down, and it's not, we'll check if the left arrowkey is down.

```lua
if love.keyboard.isDown("right") then
	x = x + 100 * dt
elseif love.keyboard.isDown("left") then
	x = x - 100 * dt
end
```
Try to make the rectangle move up and down as well.

## and & or
With `and` we can check if multiple statements are true.

 ```lua
if 5 < 9 and 14 > 7 then
	print("Both statements are true")
end
```

With `or`, the if-statement will execute if any of the statements is true.

 ```lua
if 20 < 9 or 14 > 7 or 5 == 10 then
	print("One of these statements is true")
end
```

## One more thing
To be more precise, if-statements check if the statement is NOT `false` or `nil`.
```lua
if true then print(1) end --Not false or nil, executes.
if false then print(2) end --False, doesn't execute.
if nil then print(3) end --Nil, doesn't execute
if 5 then print(4) end --Not false or nil, executes
if "hello" then print(5) end --Not false or nil, executes
--Output: 1, 4, 5
```

## Summary
With if-statements, we can allow pieces of code to only be executed when a condition is met. We can check if a number is higher, lower or equal to another number/value. A variable can be true or false. This type of variable is what we call a `boolean`. We can use `else` to tell our game what to execute when the statement was false, or `elseif` to do another check.
