# Chapter 13 - Detecting collision
Let's say we're making a game where you can shoot down monsters. A monster should die when it is hit by a bullet. So what we need to check is: Is the monster colliding with a bullet?

We're going to create a *collision check* function. We will be checking collision between rectangles. This is called AABB collision. So we need to know, when do two rectangles collide?

I created an image with three examples:

![](/images/book/13/rectangles1.png)

It's time to turn on that programmer brain if you haven't already. What is going on in the third example that isn't happening in the first and second example?

"They are colliding"

Yes, but you have to be more specific. We need information that the computer can use.

Take a look at the positions of the rectangles. In the first example, Red is not colliding with Blue, because Red is too far to the left. If Red was a bit further to the right, they would touch. How far exactly? Well, if **Red's right side** is further to the **right** than **Blue's left side**. This is something that is true for example 3. 

But it's also true for example 2. We need more conditions to be sure there is collision. So example 2 shows we can't go too far to the right. How far exactly can we go? How much would Red have to move to the left for there to be collision? When **Red's left side** is further to the **left** than **Blue's right side**.

So we have two conditions, is that enough to ensure there is collision?

Well no, look at the following image:

![](/images/book/13/rectangles2.png)

This situation agrees with our conditions. Red's right side is further to the right than Blue's left side. And Red's left side is further to the left than Blue's right side. Yet, there is no collision. That's because Red is too high. It needs to move down. How far? Till **Red's bottom side** is further to the **bottom** than **Blue's top side**.

But if we move it too far down, there won't be collision anymore. How far can Red move down, and still collide with Blue? As long as **Red's top side** is further to the **top** than **Blue's bottom side**.

Now we got four conditions. Are all four conditions true for these three examples?

![](/images/book/13/rectangles3.png)

**Red's right side** is further to the **right** than **Blue's left side**.

**Red's left side** is further to the **left** than **Blue's right side**.

**Red's bottom side** is further to the **bottom** than **Blue's top side**.

**Red's top side** is further to the **top** than **Blue's bottom side**.

Yes, they are! Now we need to turn this information into a function.

First let's create two rectangles.

```lua
function love.load()
	--Create 2 rectangles
	r1 = {
		x = 10,
		y = 100,
		width = 100,
		height = 100
	}

	r2 = {
		x = 250,
		y = 120,
		width = 150,
		height = 120
	}
end


function love.update(dt)
	--Make one of rectangle move
	r1.x = r1.x + 100 * dt
end


function love.draw()
	love.graphics.rectangle("line", r1.x, r1.y, r1.width, r1.height)
	love.graphics.rectangle("line", r2.x, r2.y, r2.width, r2.height)
end
```

Now we create a new function called checkCollision(), with 2 rectangles as parameters.

```lua
function checkCollision(a, b)

end
```

First we need the sides of the rectangles. The left side is the x position, the right side is the x position + the width. Same with y and height.

```lua
function checkCollision(a, b)
	--With locals it's common usage to use underscores instead of camelCasing
	local a_left = a.x
	local a_right = a.x + a.width
	local a_top = a.y
	local a_bottom = a.y + a.height

	local b_left = b.x
	local b_right = b.x + b.width
	local b_top = b.y
	local b_bottom = b.y + b.height
end
```

Now that we have the four sides of each rectangle, we can use them to put our conditions in an if-statement.

```lua
function checkCollision(a, b)
	--With locals it's common usage to use underscores instead of camelCasing
	local a_left = a.x
	local a_right = a.x + a.width
	local a_top = a.y
	local a_bottom = a.y + a.height

	local b_left = b.x
	local b_right = b.x + b.width
	local b_top = b.y
	local b_bottom = b.y + b.height

	--If Red's right side is further to the right than Blue's left side.
	if  a_right > b_left
	--and Red's left side is further to the left than Blue's right side.
	and a_left < b_right
	--and Red's bottom side is further to the bottom than Blue's top side.
	and a_bottom > b_top
	--and Red's top side is further to the top than Blue's bottom side then..
	and a_top < b_bottom then
		--There is collision!
		return true
	else
		--If one of these statements is false, return false.
		return false
	end
end
```

Notice that the if-condition itself is a boolean value. `checkCollision` returns `true` when the if-condition is `true` and vise-versa. Therefore `checkCollision` can be simplified into the following form:

```lua
function checkCollision(a, b)
	--With locals it's common usage to use underscores instead of camelCasing
	local a_left = a.x
	local a_right = a.x + a.width
	local a_top = a.y
	local a_bottom = a.y + a.height

	local b_left = b.x
	local b_right = b.x + b.width
	local b_top = b.y
	local b_bottom = b.y + b.height

	--Directly return this boolean value without using if-statement
	return  a_right > b_left
		and a_left < b_right
		and a_bottom > b_top
		and a_top < b_bottom
end
```

Okay, we have our function. Let's try it out! We draw the rectangles filled or lined based on  

```lua
function love.draw()
	--We create a local variable called mode
	local mode
	if checkCollision(r1, r2) then
		--If there is collision, draw the rectangles filled
		mode = "fill"
	else
		--else, draw the rectangles as a line
		mode = "line"
	end

	--Use the variable as first argument
    love.graphics.rectangle(mode, r1.x, r1.y, r1.width, r1.height)
    love.graphics.rectangle(mode, r2.x, r2.y, r2.width, r2.height)
end
```

It works! Now you know how to detect collision between two rectangles.

## Summary

Collision between two rectangles can be checked with four conditions.

Where A and B are rectangles:

A's right side is further to the right than B's left side.

A's left side is further to the left than B's right side.

A's bottom side is further to the bottom than B's top side.

A's top side is further to the top than B's bottom side.
